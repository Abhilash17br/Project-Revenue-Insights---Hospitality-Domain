## Overview:
*Project: Provide Insights to Management*

*Domain: Consumer Goods*

*Function: Executive Management*


## Domain: Consumer Goods | Function: Executive Management

*Atliq Hardwares (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too.*


## Problem Statement:

*The management of Atliq Hardwares noticed they do not get enough insights to make quick, smart data-informed decisions. They have decided to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, their data analytics director, wanted to hire someone good at tech and soft skills. Hence, he decided to conduct a SQL challenge to help him understand both skills.*


 ## Task:

*Our Task is to run SQL queries to answer 10 ad-hoc requests for which the business needs insights.*

*The target audience of this dashboard is top-level management, hence we need to create a presentation to show the insights.*

## Tools Used:

*MySQL: For SQL Queries*
*Microsoft PowerPoint: For Presenting Insights*

## Learnings from the Project:

*Variuos SQL Concepts - GROUP BY,JOINS,CTE,WINDOW FUNCTIONS,PIVOT COUNT METHOD etc..*
*Different Ways of Data Loading from Sql to POWER BI, - Data Loading for this Project Was done by connecting POWER BI to sql Database to Write Sql Queries, to load only required Data.*
*Presenting Insights using Microsoft PowerPoint.*
